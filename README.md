## üß™ Testing

### Manual Testing Checklist

- [ ] Create folder functionality
- [ ] Upload file functionality
- [ ] File and folder navigation
- [ ] Search and filtering
- [ ] Document preview
- [ ] Upload progress tracking
- [ ] Responsive design on different screen sizes
- [ ] Error handling

### Testing the APIs

Use tools like Postman or curl to test the API endpoints:

```bash
# Test folder creation
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/folders \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"name": "Test Folder", "description": "Test description"}'

# Test file upload
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/files/upload \
  -F "file=@/path/to/your/file.pdf" \
  -F "name=Test File"
```

## üö® Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**MongoDB Connection Error:**

- Ensure MongoDB service is running
- Check connection string in environment variables
- Verify MongoDB is accessible on the specified port

**File Upload Issues:**

- Check file size limits (50MB max)
- Verify supported file types
- Ensure uploads directory has write permissions

**CORS Errors:**

- Verify frontend URL in backend CORS configuration
- Check if both frontend and backend are running on expected ports

**Port Already in Use:**

- Change ports in environment variables
- Kill existing processes using the ports

### Performance Optimization

- For large file uploads, consider implementing chunked uploads
- Use database indexing for better search performance
- Implement Redis caching for frequently accessed data
- Consider CDN for file serving in production

## üîê Security Considerations

- File type validation implemented
- File size limits enforced
- Input sanitization for folder/file names
- Consider adding authentication/authorization for production use
- Implement virus scanning for uploaded files in production

## üöÄ Production Deployment

### Environment Setup

1. Set up production MongoDB instance
2. Configure environment variables for production
3. Set up file storage (consider cloud storage like AWS S3)
4. Configure reverse proxy (nginx/Apache)
5. Set up SSL certificates
6. Configure logging and monitoring
